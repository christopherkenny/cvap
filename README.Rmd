The goal of `cvap` is to work with Census citizen voting-age population (CVAP) data.

## Installation

You can install the released version of cvap from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cvap")
```

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("christopherkenny/cvap")
```
## Example

The primary tools from this package are to first download CVAP data that's already processed.

```{r example}
library(cvap)
de_cvap <- cvap_get('DE')
```

`de_cvap()` has options for the available geographies in the [Census special tabulation](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/voting-rights/cvap.html).

With that data, we can combine it with ACS and Decennial Census data to estimate block-level data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
de_block <- censable::build_dec(geography = 'block', state = state, 
                                year = 2010, geometry = FALSE)
de_block_group <- censable::build_acs(geography = 'block group', state = 'DE', 
                                      geometry = FALSE, year = 2019)
```

For example purposes, the 2010 Delaware Census block data is provided:
```{r}
data('de_block')
```

Along with the Delaware 2019 ACS data:
```{r}
data('de_block_group')
```


This allows us to distribute the block group data approximately between blocks.
```{r}
block_est <- cvap_distribute(de_cvap, de_block, de_block_group)
```


This workflow can also be combined into one function
```{r, eval = FALSE}
block_est <- cvap_distribute_censable('DE')
```


The resulting data has estimated CVAP data for each block:
```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(block_est)
```
Thus, using other packages like `PL94171`, we can easily aggregate this from blocks to VTDs, where CVAP is not directly provided. `vest_crosswalk` allows you to download a variant of VEST's crosswalk that is computationally more favorable for R.
